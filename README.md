# AJARemote---ESPHome
ESPHome Template for the AJARemote

This is a template for using ESPHome with the AJARemote hardware.  You will need a programmer inorder to install the base ESPHome firmware.  Hold down the D0 button when the device boots.  

This is the programmer I use : https://www.adafruit.com/product/70

##DO NOT connect the programmer and the USB cable at the same time

There are examples of usin RAW, PRONTO, Sony and NEC here.  For other formats, please consult the ESPHome documentation for usage.  https://esphome.io/components/remote_transmitter

Where you see "redacted", ESPHome will create these and in some case, such as WiFI information, you will need to provide details.
